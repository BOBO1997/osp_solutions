# Solutions for IBM Quantum Open Science Prize 2021

## Abstract

## Methods

We combined the following techniques to obtain the target state with higher fidelity on IBM Quantum Jakarta.
- Variational Trotter Compression (VTC)
- Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) by Pauli Twirling
- Subspace Expansion (SE)
- Parity Verification (PV) : might not be applicable
- Symmetry Verification (SV)
