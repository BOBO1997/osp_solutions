# Experiments

The numerical simulation with different trotter steps, different encoding and decoding schemes, different error mitigation levels, and different initial states.

Note that we are using [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq) package for zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE).
Please install Mitiq by `pip install mitiq` before running the codes.
